# langgraph-agents
This repository contains my hands-on work from the **Agentic AI Bootcamp (LangGraph & LangChain)**.  
It demonstrates how to design, build, and evaluate **AI agents** that use tools, memory, and multi-step workflows.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The goal is to explore **Agentic AI** using LangGraph & LangChain:
- Build **tool-using agents** (search, math, RAG).
- Design **LangGraph flows** with nodes, edges, and control logic.
- Add **memory & persistence** so agents can track conversations.
- Experiment with **multi-agent collaboration** (planner, researcher, synthesizer).
- Implement **basic evaluation** (success rate, latency, tool usage).
